# Drawing Competition Management

This repository contains a web application developed as part of a multi-subject school project. The application manages drawing competitions, allowing administrators to organize events and users to participate. It was created to gain hands-on experience in **PHP** and **SQL** during the Data course, and to learn **VPS deployment via Azure** during the Cloud course.

Although the Cloud course focused on manual VPS setup via the **Azure Portal UI**, this project also includes self-learned extensions using **Terraform** and **Ansible** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automation.

## üìö Courses Involved

- **Cloud Course**
  - Manually configure and deploy a Linux VPS through the **Azure Portal**
  - Set up and host a PHP-based web application on the VPS
  - Configure Apache, MySQL client, and database connectivity

- **Data Course**
  - Design a MySQL relational database schema
  - Build a PHP application that interacts with the database
  - Implement user authentication and competition logic
  - Perform CRUD operations via SQL and PHP

- **Self-Learning**
  - Automate infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**
  - Configure servers with **Ansible**
  - Integrate automated deployment pipelines and IaC principles

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend & Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL (hosted on Azure)
- **Server**: Linux VPS (Ubuntu)
- **Web Server**: Apache
- **IaC Tools**: Terraform, Ansible
- **Cloud Provider**: Microsoft Azure


## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Provision Azure Resources via Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### 2. Configure VPS with Ansible

Update `ansible/inventory` with your VPS IP, then run:

```bash
cd ansible
ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory
```
